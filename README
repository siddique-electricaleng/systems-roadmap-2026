Goal: Build scarce, leverage-rich systems skills while pursuing funded study options.

Primary Track (18 months):
- Systems-oriented backend engineering (Go-first)

Secondary (context only):
- Embedded/robotics concepts when useful

Dropped:
- ML/AI hype chasing
- Pure SWE LeetCode grind beyond basics

Rule:
- Daily boring progress beats sporadic ambition.
- Applications run in parallel, not instead of skill-building.
