Goal: Create a working baseline of a *Go HTTP server*, not mastery.

0-10 mins: Minimal server in main.go
  - main.go
  - net/http
  - One route: /
  - Start server on :8080
  - Test in browser or curl
10–25 min — Logging
  - Log method, path, status
  - Use log.Println
  - Confirm logs on each request
25–40 min — Health + shutdown
  - Add /health endpoint (returns 200 OK)
  - Add graceful shutdown using context + os.Signal
40–60 min — Write README

In this md write:
What this server does?

What could break (timeouts, concurrency, bad input)?

What you don’t understand yet?
