Who I am:
- 26, Bangladesh
- Year 2026
- ECSE graduate (Monash) finished courses in December 2022
- Low-income only 29k every month, little to no financial buffer
- Goal: increase leverage via systems engineering (wanting to learn ML and Computer vision for robotics and become a polymath - the parenthesis section is self-written rest is AI generated, asked it for the context it recalls, so I can reuse this for future)

Constraints:
- Must earn while learning
- Limited hardware budget
- Applying for funded study options in parallel (already applied to Polimi in Italy with acceptance, emailed only Prof Eric Cheng in UC Merced - seeking Austria, China, Asian countries like Japan and Korea too for funded options and likely a bit of Canada and Australia)

Decisions made:
- Primary track: systems-oriented backend (Go)
- Dropped: ML hype, pure robotics, LeetCode grind
- Rule: daily boring progress, no hero sprints

What I need from ChatGPT/genAI:
- Concrete next steps
- Code review
- Career translation
- No motivational fluff
- No usage of the word fluff (this is also what I personally wrote not genAI like ChatGPT)
